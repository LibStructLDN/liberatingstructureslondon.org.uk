title: Liberating Structures Immersion Workshop
excerpt: Join this one day online immersive learning experience on 19 March
---

Following the success of our recent [virtual immersion workshop](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lsonline20&src=recent_search_click), we're running another on Friday 19 March 2021.

The workshop will offer you a hands on experience of the breadth and depth of
Liberating Structures. We'll explore LS principles, hear stories of real-world
applications, practice developing strings of structures for our own project or
situation.

You'll leave equipped with a rich and adaptable toolkit to unleash the
creativity and talent of everyone in your team, work group, community, and
organisation.

Book your place now on [Happy's website](https://www.happy.co.uk/leadership-and-personal-development/personal-development-programmes/liberating-structures-immersion-workshop/).
