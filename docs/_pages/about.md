We are a friendly and informal group who meet once a month to practice Liberating Structures.

We like to think of the meetup as a playground or laboratory, a safe place
where you can experiment with LS.

We meet on the 4th Tuesday of the month. 

**[We need venues](/venues-needed) for future meetups!**
