Our June meetup will take place on Tuesday 25 June 2019 at Cloudflare, County Hall, Belvedere Rd, South Bank, London SE1 7GP.

We haven't planned the meetup yet.

If you have ideas or suggestions of what you'd like to do, please [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](https://join.slack.com/t/liberatingstructures/shared_invite/enQtNTQ1MTQwODY1NjA1LTMxZTI2Y2U3NjU0YzcyNmRlMGFiNmUzMzhkNDAxOTU3OWM3NGQ3ODAzOTQzMGQyY2QxOWQ5MjYyZmE5ODljZTI) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
