Our September meetup will take place on Tuesday 24 Sept 2019 at [GDS in Aldgate East](/venues/gds).

**You must register for a place via eventbrite**

If you'd like to ask us questions or chat with other meetup members, [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](https://join.slack.com/t/liberatingstructures/shared_invite/enQtNTQ1MTQwODY1NjA1LTMxZTI2Y2U3NjU0YzcyNmRlMGFiNmUzMzhkNDAxOTU3OWM3NGQ3ODAzOTQzMGQyY2QxOWQ5MjYyZmE5ODljZTI) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
