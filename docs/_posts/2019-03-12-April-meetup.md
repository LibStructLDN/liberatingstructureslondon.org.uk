Our April meetup will take place on Tuesday 30 April 2019 at Wellcome Trust.

We haven't planned the meetup yet.

If you have ideas or suggestions of what you'd like to do, please [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](https://join.slack.com/t/liberatingstructures/shared_invite/enQtNTQ1MTQwODY1NjA1LTMxZTI2Y2U3NjU0YzcyNmRlMGFiNmUzMzhkNDAxOTU3OWM3NGQ3ODAzOTQzMGQyY2QxOWQ5MjYyZmE5ODljZTI) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
