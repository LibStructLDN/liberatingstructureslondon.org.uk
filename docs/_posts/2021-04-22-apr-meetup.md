Want to join our next virtual meetup?

The meetup is a safe space and 'playground' to experiment with Liberating Structures.

Pre-pandemic we met in person in a central London location, but for the time being we continue to meet virtually, and explore the possibilities that virtual meetings offer.

Each month we invite two community members, with support from the core organising team (David Heath and Alexis Pala) to plan the meetup around a theme, idea or set of structures that they wish to explore. If you'd like to volunteer to do that or to find out more about it, please [contact us](/about/#contact-us).

You can see a past meeting plans and slide decks in our [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/17_KHIdZ4-AV-q95-osB7qXJNs3cvYCM-).

**Our next meet up will be on 27 April.**
