## Liberating Structures London website

Built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) static site generator and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

## Local development

You'll need ruby (I recommend installing via [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)) and [bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Then:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:LibStructLDN/liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk.git
$ cd liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
