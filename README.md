## Liberating Structures London website

This is the website for the London Liberating Structures meetup group hosted at www.liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk. 

If you want to contribute to the website feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/LibStructLDN/liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk/issues/new) describing your suggestion. You can also raise a 'pull request' which is a way of proposing a specific change.

## Technical details

The site is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) static site generator and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme.

## Local development

You'll need ruby (I recommend installing via [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)) and [bundler](https://bundler.io/).

Then:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:LibStructLDN/liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk.git
$ cd liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

.
