We need host venues who would like to host the meetup.

Are you interested in supporting this valuable community learning group, at the cutting edge of organisational change and new ways of working?

We love connecting with host organisations, and moving the meetup around different hosts helps us to connect with different user groups and constituencies.

Previous venue hosts have included leading software development companies, major central government bodies, consultancies and training companies.

### Meetup format

* 18:00 - Doors open
* 18:30 - Meetup starts
* 19:30 - Break
* 20:30 - Meetup ends
* 21:00 - Vacate space

We typically have around 30-40 people at the meetup, although we could have more if there was a suitable space.

We generally don't offer catering at the meetup, although if your company would be willing to sponsor food or other refreshments that would be welcome!

We'd like to ensure that venues are wheelchair accessible.

We meet on 4th Tuesday of the month.. If you have a space that you can offer for any of the following dates, [please get in touch](mailto:hello@liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk)!
