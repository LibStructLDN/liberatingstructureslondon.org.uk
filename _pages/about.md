We are a friendly and informal group who meet once a month to practice Liberating Structures.

We like to think of the meetup as a playground or laboratory, a safe place
where you can experiment with LS.

We usually meet on the 4th Tuesday of the month. Registrations usually open around 1 week before.

Sign up to our [email list](https://bit.ly/lsldnemail) for announcements about registration and other relevant news.

The meetup is led by [David Heath](https://twitter.com/dgheath21).

You can follow us on twitter [@LibStructLDN](https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN).
