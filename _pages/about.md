We are a friendly and informal group who meet once a month to practice Liberating Structures.

We like to think of the meetup as a playground or laboratory, a safe place
where you can experiment with LS.

We meet on the 4th Tuesday of the month. 

**[We need venues](/venues-needed) for future meetups!**

Dates for 2020:

- 25/2
- 24/3
- 28/4

- 30/6

Registrations open approx 1-2 weeks before the meetup. Sign up to our [email list](https://bit.ly/lsldnemail) for announcements about registration and other relevant news.

Join us in [slack](/slack) to give-and-get help from the global LS community, and other practitioners in London.

The meetup is led by the community of participants, we follow an open [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process) and you're welcome to get involved.
