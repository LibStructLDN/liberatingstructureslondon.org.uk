We are partnering with training company Happy Ltd to offer this two day
immersion workshop.

The workshop will offer you a hands on experience of the breadth and depth of
Liberating Structures. We'll explore LS principles, hear stories of real-world
applications, practice developing strings of structures for our own project or
situation.

You'll leave equipped with a rich and adaptable toolkit to unleash the
creativity and talent of everyone in your team, work group, community, and
organisation.
