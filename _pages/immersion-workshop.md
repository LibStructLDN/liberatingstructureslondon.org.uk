excerpt: Join this one day online immersive learning experience on 30 Apr
---

Previously advertised as a two-day in-person event, we're now offering this as a one-day online event on Thursday 30 Apr, in partnership with Happy Ltd.

The workshop will offer you a hands on experience of the breadth and depth of
Liberating Structures. We'll explore LS principles, hear stories of real-world
applications, practice developing strings of structures for our own project or
situation.

You'll leave equipped with a rich and adaptable toolkit to unleash the
creativity and talent of everyone in your team, work group, community, and
organisation.

Book your place now on [Happy's website](https://www.happy.co.uk/leadership-and-personal-development/live-online-interactive-learning/liberating-structures-online-immersion-workshop/).
