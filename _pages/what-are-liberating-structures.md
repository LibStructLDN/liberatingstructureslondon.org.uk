title: What are Liberating Structures?
---

Liberating Structures are a collection of 33+ methods or 'structures' for working
in groups of any size.

Each structure descibes a set of simple rules to achieve a particular outcome.
The structures address [five elements](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/design-elements/) of every group interaction, which are
sometimes neglected or overlooked in more mundane business formats like a
presentation:

- invitation
- sequence of steps
- distribution of participation 
- arrangement of space and materials needed
- configuration of groups

Each structure has been design and carefully field tested with these goals:

- include everyone equally
- work at multiple scales, all the way from individual reflection right up to groups of 500+
- get better-than-expected results
- work in fast iterations
- be easy to learn
- be safe to use by non-experts without needing extensive training
- be FUN!
- be combined and re-combined with other LS

They were developed and refined by Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz in the [early 2000s](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/history/), drawing inspiration from Brenda Zimmermann's [Edgeware](https://www.worldcat.org/title/edge-ware-lessons-from-complexity-science-for-health-care-leaders/oclc/230923988), which applied insights from complexity science to health care leadership.
