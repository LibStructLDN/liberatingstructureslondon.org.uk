title: What are Liberating Structures?
---

Liberating Structures are a collection of 33+ methods or 'structures' for working
in groups of any size.

Each structure has been designed and carefully field tested to:

- include everyone equally
- work at multiple scales, from a single individual up to large groups of 500+
- get better-than-expected results
- be used in fast iterations
- be easy to learn
- be safe to use by non-experts without needing extensive training
- be seriously playful
- be endlessly composable and re-combineable

Each structure descibes a set of simple rules to achieve a particular outcome.

They expand the vocabulary of structures used in typical business meetings, from 'the big 5'

- presentation
- managed discussion
- status update
- brainstorm
- open discussion

The simplest structure [1-2-4-all](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/) is designed to _engage everyone simultaneously in generating questions, ideas, and suggestions_, here's how it works:

1. state your question, prompt or invitation, for example "how can we improve our work together?"
2. everyone takes **1 minute** in silence to reflect on the prompt and come up with their own answers or responses
3. individuals organise into pairs and take **two minutes** to discuss their responses to the prompt. Were there ideas in common, or big differences? Is there a consensus or preference emerging?
4. each pair finds another pair and takes **four minutes** to share, explore and refine their responses
5. each group plays back their top insights, observations or recommendations [1 minute per group]

in this way, in the space of 10-15 minutes, a group of any size can respond to a question or prompt and:
- every person is fully engaged throughout
- every person contributes equally
- ideas from quieter people (which may be the best ideas in the room) have a chance to surface and be amplified

Liberating Structures were developed and refined by Keith McCandless and Henri Lipmanowicz in the [early 2000s](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/history/), drawing inspiration from Brenda Zimmermann's [Edgeware](https://www.worldcat.org/title/edge-ware-lessons-from-complexity-science-for-health-care-leaders/oclc/230923988), which applied insights from complexity science to health care leadership.
