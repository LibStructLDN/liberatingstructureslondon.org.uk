Our April meetup will take place on Tuesday 30 July 2019 at [Potato](https://p.ota.to/), The Network Building, 97 Tottenham Court Road, W1T 4TP.

We haven't planned the meetup yet. 

If you have ideas or suggestions of what you'd like to do, please [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](https://join.slack.com/t/liberatingstructures/shared_invite/enQtNTQ1MTQwODY1NjA1LTMxZTI2Y2U3NjU0YzcyNmRlMGFiNmUzMzhkNDAxOTU3OWM3NGQ3ODAzOTQzMGQyY2QxOWQ5MjYyZmE5ODljZTI) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
