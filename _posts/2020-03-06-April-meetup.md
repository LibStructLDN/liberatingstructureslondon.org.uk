**You must register for a place via eventbrite. Registrations are not open yet, if you'd like to be first to hear, please join our [email list](/email-list)**

If you'd like to ask us questions or chat with other meetup members, [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](/slack) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
