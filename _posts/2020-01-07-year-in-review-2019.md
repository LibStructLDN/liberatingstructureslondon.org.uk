## Year in review

2019 was the second year of LS London. We've had a lot of fun exploring and playing with the LS community. Here's a quick recap of what we've done:

### January 2019

For our first meetup of the year, Nikki Wilson took us through a personal reflection and evaluation using [Ecocycle planning](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/31-ecocycle-planning/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kicking off the new year and our 1st anniversary meetup with some new year reflections using ecocycle planning and peer-to-peer coaching with troika. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/NiksClicks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NiksClicks</a> for the great theme, with Rook, <a href="https://twitter.com/dgheath21?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dgheath21</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Nataliesalmon6?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nataliesalmon6</a> <a href="https://t.co/bvs9YaJHdU">pic.twitter.com/bvs9YaJHdU</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1087802732042485762?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We followed with some peer-to-peer coaching using Troika consulting.

Around the community, the UK Government's "Transforming Together" community published it's 7 Lenses maturity matrix, and [recommended use of Liberating Structures in maturity assessment workshops](https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1085155144843575296).

Arif Bobat, a graduate of the November 2018 2-day LS immersion workshop, [ran a very well received workshop on change for an internal community at his organisation](https://twitter.com/arifbobat/status/1085699537354788864), based on LS.

Kathleen and David had fun [introducing journalists and data hackers to Liberating Structures at the Hacks/Hackers meetup](https://twitter.com/FraZaffarano/status/1093139769662545920).


## February

In February we explored the world of [OKRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) and how they relate to Liberating Structures.

[Peter Kappus](https://twitter.com/peterkappus) introduced us to OKRs:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‚ÄúCheck in on progress regularly‚Äîuse ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô as the metric to have rich, sometimes difficult, but always productive retrospectives or performance reviews.‚Äù<a href="https://twitter.com/peterkappus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@peterkappus</a> talking <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OKR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OKR</a>‚Äôs at <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LibStructLDN</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> <a href="https://t.co/7VcsJt5ED6">pic.twitter.com/7VcsJt5ED6</a></p>&mdash; Alex Blanes (@daftmonk) <a href="https://twitter.com/daftmonk/status/1100481536669949952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We then ran a [shift-and-share](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/11-shift-share/) where four different practitioners gave stories and shared their perspectives and experiences on applying OKRs and other methods for organisational alignment and evaluation.

We concluded the meetup by [exploring wicked questions](https://twitter.com/daftmonk/status/1100479389454819328), a way to explore paradox in a constructive way.

Around the community, Alexis Pala of YLab Wales published an article in Apolitical about how [Liberating Structures help organisations avoid groupthink and tap into collective intelligence](https://apolitical.co/solution_article/liberating-structures-the-simple-rules-that-could-transform-public-innovation/), and also started the [Cardiff LS meetup](https://palaa10.wixsite.com/lscardiff) which has been going strong since then!

## March

Our march meetup explored Improv Prototyping, a fun way to rehearse and refine interpersonal interactions. See the twitter thread for some reflections:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few scenes <a href="https://t.co/ikE73aSOPQ">pic.twitter.com/ikE73aSOPQ</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1110671809622540288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

March was also the occasion of the first ever LS Global Gathering, which took place in Seattle. Kathleen blogged about it here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The surprising power of working together to achieve more than any of us could alone. How the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> Global Gathering catalysed collaboration, before, during and after the event. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LSGG2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LSGG2019</a> üó£Ô∏è Questions?

## April

April's meetup was hosted by [Katie Taylor](https://twitter.com/katieminatie) at the Wellcome Trust.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great to be at Wellcome trust this evening hosted by the wonderful <a href="https://twitter.com/katieminatie?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@katieminatie</a>, exploring the paradoxes of openness and transparency using wicked questions <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> <a href="https://t.co/Le2Yb3WHGe">pic.twitter.com/Le2Yb3WHGe</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1123305809616699393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We explored the paradoxes of openness and transparency using wicked questions.

## May

In May we hosted our first "home grown" two day immersion workshop, organised by members of London Liberating Structures community in partnership with Happy Ltd:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Principles walkaround with <a href="https://twitter.com/gobrightly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gobrightly</a> at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lslondonimmersion?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#lslondonimmersion</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/happyltd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@happyltd</a> <a href="https://t.co/UxXigllmnt">pic.twitter.com/UxXigllmnt</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1123931109157482496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**[Join us again this spring -- 30 April-1 May 2020](https://www.happy.co.uk/leadership-and-personal-development/personal-development-programmes/liberating-structures-immersion-workshop/)**


Our May meetup was also hosted by Happy, where explored how we can create happy workplaces:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tonight we‚Äôre exploring the theme of happy workplaces. <br><br>Now we‚Äôre using Triz to identify counterproductive behaviours to stop <a href="https://t.co/xcyWimsTG9">https://t.co/xcyWimsTG9</a> <a href="https://t.co/NimxzEuOVp">pic.twitter.com/NimxzEuOVp</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1133434917919105024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## June

In June we were in a lovely space at Cloudflare on the South Bank. We decided to explore [purpose-to-practice](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/33-purpose-to-practice-p2p/) a structure which is also a string of structures and invitations.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really enjoyed my first <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> meet-up - love the way we just got on and tried things out and debriefed them afterwards and venue was amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/facilitation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#facilitation</a> <a href="https://t.co/dYAE69Yn3o">https://t.co/dYAE69Yn3o</a></p>&mdash; Hilary Topp (@HTFacilitation) <a href="https://twitter.com/HTFacilitation/status/1143647292832079872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We ran out of time to complete the full five elements, but managed to make some good progress on Purpose and Principles:

### Purpose - This meetup exists in order to:

Around the wider LS community, Zoe Lord and her colleagues started off a new Midlands LS user group:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our new Midlands <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> user group! We‚Äôre a new group in the midlands with a health &amp; care focus. Let us know if you‚Äôd like to be involved! Next meet up Friday 5th July 3pm online. <a href="https://t.co/IGjD3kH4Nt">pic.twitter.com/IGjD3kH4Nt</a></p>&mdash; Zo√´ Lord (@ZoeLord1) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeLord1/status/1144630839311032321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was also really great to see Chris Smith using LS for a large-scale company retrospective:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enjoyed running a 2019 H1 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/retrospective?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#retrospective</a> for all our <a href="https://twitter.com/RedgateProdDev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RedgateProdDev</a> Product Development teams this morning! Finally got chance to use some <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/liberatingstructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#liberatingstructures</a> with a large group and got some fantastic insights on where we should look to improve! <a href="https://t.co/5Qs0uoJnNW">pic.twitter.com/5Qs0uoJnNW</a></p>&mdash; Chris Smith (@cj_smithy) <a href="https://twitter.com/cj_smithy/status/1143869766777675776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## July

July's meetup was hosted by Potato London and led by [Kathleen Bright](https://twitter.com/gobrightly). The theme was exploring burnout and recovery using [Drawing Together](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/20-drawing-together/) and [Discovery and Action Dialogue](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/10-discovery-action-dialogue/).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enjoyed my first <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LibStructLDN</a> at Potatoe. We did &#39;Drawing Together&#39; and &#39;Discovery &amp; Action Dialogue.&#39; Also a useful group coaching process about burnout. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OrgHacking?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OrgHacking</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gobrightly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gobrightly</a> <a href="https://t.co/T4lTBrO0mH">pic.twitter.com/T4lTBrO0mH</a></p>&mdash; designing services (@incluservice) <a href="https://twitter.com/incluservice/status/1156309001191284739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 30, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Around the network, the Scotland user group held another meetup:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> meetup Edinburgh with <a href="https://twitter.com/ktmcnl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ktmcnl</a> üí•üí™üèΩ <a href="https://t.co/Kfmj9AG3C7">pic.twitter.com/Kfmj9AG3C7</a></p>&mdash; Leah Lockhart (@LockhartL) <a href="https://twitter.com/LockhartL/status/1151853157162586113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## August - Social network webbing

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We had fun exploring Social network webbing this evening. A few takeaways:- visualising our network helps us to think about it in a different way. Making it tangible makes it possible for multiple people to collaborate. (1/n) <a href="https://t.co/kjwPgJJw4c">pic.twitter.com/kjwPgJJw4c</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1166457082243158018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


A few takeaways:

- visualising our network helps us to think about it in a different way.
- Making it tangible makes it possible for multiple people to collaborate.
- Patterns and connections are revealed which would otherwise be hard to identify.
- One person described how a conversation is ‚Äúone dimensional‚Äù whereas the visualisation makes it two dimensional.
- At the same time we felt that the conversations and discussions as the network map was developed are more important than the final artefact.

Ideas for possible application include helping to spread ideas and good practice through and organisation and business development.

Focusing on ‚Äúweak‚Äù connections and gaps in the network can help grow diversity.

### European learning gathering

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LSELG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LSELG</a> 2019 - backflash.

Some of us also attended the Liberating Structures European Learning Gathering in Hamburg. Kathleen wrote another awesome [blog post](https://brightlyk.com/2019/08/12/the-week-that-started-5th-august/) about what they learned. Check the [#LSELG](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lselg&src=typed_query) hashtag for more highlights.

## September

We explored building LS strings using the LS match maker:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Learnt to select structures for various purposes using Matchmaker <a href="https://t.co/3nKiGNONUM">https://t.co/3nKiGNONUM</a> and string them together <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LibStructLDN</a> today. A moving theme on the value of enabling human connection emerged through the evening. <a href="https://t.co/Fc1QHpbLjO">pic.twitter.com/Fc1QHpbLjO</a></p>&mdash; designing services (@incluservice) <a href="https://twitter.com/incluservice/status/1176635933380227076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

A very fruitful pub conversation led us to discover [Paul Tolchinsky](https://twitter.com/PaulTolchinsky), a leading thinker in the world of Organisation Design.

## October - Service design

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Explored Improv Prototyping <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LibStructLDN</a> yesterday, as an idea generating method for service design. Learnt loads having fun - way to go. A string of Fishbowl, 1-2-All, and Improv Proto made for a rich learning together experience. <a href="https://t.co/9m8xHLk4OD">pic.twitter.com/9m8xHLk4OD</a></p>&mdash; designing services (@incluservice) <a href="https://twitter.com/incluservice/status/1186972709709848577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We started with a [UX Fishbowl](https://twitter.com/HPFTCQI/status/1186702373684764672) where service design practitioners explained a bit about the ideas and principles of service design.

Then we played with [Improv prototyping](https://twitter.com/incluservice/status/1186972709709848577) to see how they might be used to prototype services. Hilarity ensued as people put on their best acting voice to play the role of an elevator, email message or street map!

Joe Badman wrote up a really nice [blog post](https://twitter.com/TheJoeBadman/status/1187085481496006657).

### Immersion workshop

We also held our second Immersion workshop of the year, supported by LS Pioneers [Fisher Qua](https://twitter.com/sfqua) and [Anna Jackson](https://twitter.com/alpinista_anna).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fantastic first day of immersion into <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiberatingStructures?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LiberatingStructures</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/happyltd?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@happyltd</a>. We dug deep into how we can unleash ourselves and others through intentionally designing the microstructures of our daily interactions. Now for digestion, decomposition, reflection and another day tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/Fp0hsrOF1u">pic.twitter.com/Fp0hsrOF1u</a></p>&mdash; Liberating Structures London (@LibStructLDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN/status/1189239775502458880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Paul Brennan of Cardiff University joined the design team for the workshop and [blogged about his learnings](https://twitter.com/brennanpcardiff/status/1190302158471782400).

Workshop participant John Burgoyne from the Centre for Public impact also [blogged his reflections](https://twitter.com/JohnBurgoyne07/status/1194186299433005063).

## November - Critical uncertainties

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A great night hosting <a href="https://twitter.com/LibStructLDN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LibStructLDN</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/pivotal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pivotal</a> London.

Another new structure to us, [Critical Uncertainties](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/30-critical-uncertainties/) helps individuals or groups build robust and resilient plans for an uncertain future.

## Summing up

Having reviewed all that's happened this year, we've covered a huge amount. The network of Liberating Structures practitioners and users in the UK and around the world has grown.

For 2020 we'd like to continue to support and grow the community of LS practitioners. We always love to hear from you about what's going well in your practice or what questions you have. Please drop us an email with your thoughts, suggestions or questions.

We also always need more help with running the meetup. Here are some examples of things that we need:

- planning events, get involved with the design process
- writing for the website
- writing emails, twitter and other social media channels
- organising logistics for events
- finding and confirming venues

If you'd like to get involved please drop us an [email](mailto:hello@liberatingstructureslondon.org.uk)!
