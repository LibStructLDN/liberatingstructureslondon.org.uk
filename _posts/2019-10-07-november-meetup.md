Our October meetup will take place on Tuesday 26 November 2019 at [Pivotal in Old Street](/venues/pivotal).

**You must register for a place via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/liberating-structures-london-november-2019-tickets-78334678131)**

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
