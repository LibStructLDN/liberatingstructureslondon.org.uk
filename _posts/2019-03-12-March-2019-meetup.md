Our March meetup will take place on Tuesday 26 March 2019 at [GDS](/venues/gds).

**You must register for a place via eventbrite**

At this month's meetup, we're going to experiment with a structure called Improv prototyping. If you're familiar with prototyping from the design or software world this structure is a little bit different. It's about protyping our interpersonal behaviours and interactions, rather than prototyping software, websites or user interfaces.

Sounds intriguing? Yes, for us too! We haven't used this structure ourselves before, so we'll be exploring and experimenting together. We'll build in time for some playful warmups and plenty of time for reflection, debriefing and experimentation. Come along with your most playful and curious selves!

If you'd like to ask questions or get involved in the meetup, please [join us in the `#london` channel in slack](https://join.slack.com/t/liberatingstructures/shared_invite/enQtNTQ1MTQwODY1NjA1LTMxZTI2Y2U3NjU0YzcyNmRlMGFiNmUzMzhkNDAxOTU3OWM3NGQ3ODAzOTQzMGQyY2QxOWQ5MjYyZmE5ODljZTI) to discuss.

We follow an open design process for the meetups. Typically we have two video calls the two Tuesdays prior to the meetup. If you're interested to get involved in planning a meetup, please take a look at the [meetup design process](/meetup-design-process).
